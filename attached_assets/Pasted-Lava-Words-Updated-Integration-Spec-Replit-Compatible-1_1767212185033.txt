Lava Words — Updated Integration Spec (Replit-Compatible)

1) Speech Behavior (Clarification)

Lava Words does not speak the words.
It only listens for the child’s speech and uses that input to “save” creatures.

Suggested behavior:
	•	Creatures display a word visually.
	•	The game listens continuously (or via your existing press-to-talk model).
	•	When the child says a word correctly, the matching creature is cleared.

Fallback remains consistent with the rest of the app:
	•	Manual ✓ / X (if you already support it elsewhere) can be available if speech is unreliable.

⸻

2) Placement in the Product (Two Access Paths)

A) Lesson Mode (guided journey)

If the user taps Start Lesson, the recommended order is:
	1.	Word Pop Game
	2.	Flashcards
	3.	Lava Words
	4.	Celebratory sentence / moment

All steps use the same deck / word set for that book/session.

B) Free Play Mode (book page options)

On each Book screen, Lava Words should also appear as a standalone option, alongside the other modes.

Suggested layout at the bottom of each book:
	•	Play Word Pop
	•	Play Flashcards
	•	Play Lava Words
	•	Start Lesson (runs the full sequence)

This matches your existing pattern (separate play buttons + a guided lesson entry point).

⸻

3) Word Set Consistency (Deck Reuse)

Lava Words should pull from the same active deck the user is working on (whatever your current deck-generation logic provides).

Important constraints:
	•	Lava Words uses only the words in the deck.
	•	It does not introduce additional words.
	•	It repeats the same words until they are cleared.

⸻

4) “Clear a Word” Rule (Linked to Deck Settings)

Instead of a fixed “4 correct,” tie the number of correct saves required to your existing setting.

Suggested setting
	•	required_correct_to_clear
	•	range: 3 to 10
	•	default: 4

Behavior
	•	Each word in the deck has a session counter:
	•	correct_saves_for_word
	•	When correct_saves_for_word >= required_correct_to_clear:
	•	that word is removed from the active Lava Words loop (no longer spawns)
	•	The game ends when all deck words are cleared OR the player runs out of lives.

This makes Lava Words automatically adapt to:
	•	different deck difficulty preferences
	•	parent/teacher control
	•	“quick win” mode vs “deep repetition” mode

⸻

5) Lives (Suggested Defaults)
	•	Default lives: 3
	•	If a creature hits the lava:
	•	lose 1 life
	•	If lives reach 0:
	•	game ends early
	•	remaining words stay uncleared (still available next time)

⸻

6) End-of-Game → Celebration

When Lava Words ends (cleared or failed):
	•	show the celebratory sentence
	•	optional GIF / animation
	•	then return to:
	•	Lesson flow summary (if in Start Lesson), or
	•	Book screen (if played standalone)

⸻

7) Summary of What’s Now Explicitly True
	•	Lava Words does not speak words
	•	Lava Words only listens for speech
	•	Lava Words is available:
	•	as standalone play under each book, and
	•	as Step 3 inside Start Lesson
	•	Clearing a word uses required_correct_to_clear:
	•	range 3–10
	•	default 4
	•	Lava Words uses only the active deck words and repeats them until cleared
