Frame it as a Parent Reading Tracker + Mastery Flashcards: each reading session uploads page photos → OCR + cleanup → the app updates the child’s word library, automatically queues only newly encountered words into the flashcard deck (excluding already-known/mastered words), and provides a “History Test” mode that can re-test previously learned words on demand (refresh) to prevent forgetting.

Flashcards (Mastery Mode)

Deck source: defaults to New Words Queue = words with status new (or learning if user chooses) and not mastered

Deck size: e.g., 10 at a time (configurable)

Flow:

show one word (large)

parent taps ✓ if child says correctly, X if not

✓ increments mastery_correct_count

X increments incorrect_count (and optionally decreases mastery count by 1 if you want)

shuffle continuously

Mastery rule: when mastery_correct_count >= 10 → status becomes mastered and it leaves the active deck

History Test (Refresh Mode)

Purpose: re-check retention.

Pick list: previously mastered words (or “learning” words) based on:

last_tested oldest first, or

random sample, or

most frequent historically

Refresh action: “Generate a 20-word review test”

runs the same flashcard UI

logs results; if missed, optionally demote from mastered → learning

Simple settings

Stop-words toggle (common words)

Grade/level filter toggle (restrict to age-appropriate words list)

Mastery threshold (default 10)

Deck size (default 10)

Demote on misses in refresh test (on/off)

Do you want the “History Test” to demote a mastered word if missed (keeps it honest), or just record misses without changing mastery?
