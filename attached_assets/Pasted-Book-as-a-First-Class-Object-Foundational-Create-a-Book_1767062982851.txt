Book as a First-Class Object (Foundational)

Create a Book entity in the system, not just sessions.

Book object includes:
	•	Title
	•	Author
	•	Grade band
	•	Cover image
	•	ISBN (if available)
	•	Canonical word list (normalized)
	•	Prep-word list (filtered, tiered)
	•	Popularity / usage count
	•	Source type:
	•	Public-domain
	•	Teacher-uploaded
	•	Parent-uploaded
	•	Curated (Osmosify)

This allows books to be reused, improved, and trusted.

2. Book Discovery & Selection (Parent + Teacher Friendly)

Book Library Screen
	•	Search by:
	•	title
	•	grade
	•	“almost ready for my child”
	•	Visual grid with book covers (this matters emotionally)

Each book shows:
	•	Cover
	•	Readiness score for this child
	•	“Prepare X words to unlock”

⸻

3. Links to the Actual Book (Very Important)

For each book, include safe, non-intrusive links:

Supported link types
	•	Amazon
	•	Bookshop.org (teacher-friendly, indie)
	•	Library lookup (WorldCat-style)
	•	“Already have this book” toggle

This positions Osmosify as supporting reading, not replacing it.

⸻

4. Community-Sourced Book Prep (Network Effect)

Upload once → benefit everyone

Flow:
	1.	Parent or teacher uploads pages / scans a book
	2.	Osmosify:
	•	extracts words
	•	cleans
	•	generates prep list
	3.	User opts to:
“Contribute this book to the Osmosify Library”

Safeguards
	•	No page images shared publicly
	•	Only normalized word lists + metadata
	•	Attribution badge:
“Prepared by a teacher in Ohio”

This avoids copyright issues while still compounding value.

⸻

5. Trust Levels for Book Packs

Not all book prep is equal—signal that.

Prep source labels:
	•	Osmosify Curated
	•	Teacher Contributed
	•	Community Verified (used by X classrooms)
	•	Personal (private)

This builds confidence and reduces hesitation.

⸻

6. Book Readiness, Now Smarter

Because books are shared, readiness gets better:
	•	% of words mastered globally by grade
	•	% of words mastered by this child
	•	Estimated friction level

UI copy:

This book is commonly unlocked after preparing 8–12 words.

⸻

7. Book Timeline (Long-Term Value)

Each child gets a reading journey:
	•	Books prepared
	•	Books unlocked
	•	Books read

Parents don’t just see words—they see a path.

⸻

8. Incentivize Contribution (Quietly)

No points. No badges.

Instead:
	•	“Thanks for preparing this book—34 families won’t have to do it again.”
	•	Teacher dashboard shows:
“Your contributions saved 12 hours of prep time this month.”

That’s meaningful.

⸻

9. What NOT to Share (Important)

Never share:
	•	Full text
	•	Page images
	•	Sentence-level content

Only share:
	•	Normalized word sets
	•	Frequencies
	•	Difficulty metadata

You stay safe and scalable.

10. Why This Is a Moat

Once this exists:
	•	Every new book strengthens the platform
	•	Parents feel helped by other parents
	•	Teachers feel they’re contributing to a system
	•	Switching costs rise naturally

This is how Osmosify becomes infrastructure, not an app.
