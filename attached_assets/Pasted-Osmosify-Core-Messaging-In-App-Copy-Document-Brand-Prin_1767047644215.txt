Core Explanation (Short)

Most kids can’t read a full book—not because they can’t read, but because too many words are unfamiliar.
Osmosify solves that before the book ever opens.

How Osmosify Works

Step 1 — Words First

Osmosify collects and tracks the words your child is exposed to through reading sessions and book preparation.

Step 2 — Quiet Mastery

Words are practiced naturally until they’re truly known—no pressure, no drills, no forced reading.

Step 3 — The Reveal

When your child opens the book, the words feel familiar.
Reading suddenly works.

Title
